# Complex Task Executor

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when a task meets ANY of the following criteria:
- Requires more than 3 distinct steps to complete
- Involves multiple tools or information sources
- Has dependencies between steps (step B needs output from step A)
- Requires research before execution
- Could benefit from a documented plan others can review
- The user explicitly asks for a thorough or systematic approach

**DO NOT use this for simple tasks** like answering a question, reading a single file, or performing one tool call.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Task Analysis (THINK before acting)

Before creating any files, analyze the task:

1. **Understand the goal**: What is the final deliverable? What does "done" look like?
2. **Assess complexity**: How many steps? What tools are needed?
3. **Identify dependencies**: Which steps depend on others?
4. **Identify risks**: What could go wrong? What information is missing?
5. **Estimate scope**: Is the task feasible with available tools/skills?

### Phase 2: Create Task Plan

Create a task folder and plan file in the workspace:

```
workspace/<task-name>/plan.md
```

The plan.md MUST follow this exact format:

```markdown
# Task: <Clear title>

## Objective
<One-sentence description of the desired outcome>

## Steps

- [ ] 1. <First step — verb-noun format>
  - Details: <What specifically to do>
  - Output: <What this step produces>
- [ ] 2. <Second step>
  - Details: <...>
  - Depends on: Step 1
- [ ] 3. <Third step>
  - Details: <...>

## Status
- Created: <timestamp>
- Current Step: Not started
- Progress: 0/<total>

## Notes
<Any assumptions, risks, or open questions>
```

Rules for writing the plan:
- Each step should be completable in 1-3 tool calls
- Use verb-noun format: "Research competitors", "Draft report", "Validate data"
- Mark dependencies explicitly
- Include expected outputs for each step

### Phase 3: Execute Step-by-Step

For EACH step in the plan:

1. **Read the plan** — Call `read_file` on `workspace/<task>/plan.md` to check current state
2. **Mark as in-progress** — Update the checkbox from `[ ]` to `[/]` and update the "Current Step" field
3. **Execute the step** — Do the actual work (tool calls, analysis, writing)
4. **Record output** — Save results to `workspace/<task>/` (e.g., intermediate files, data)
5. **Mark as complete** — Update the checkbox from `[/]` to `[x]` and update "Progress" counter
6. **Proceed to next step** — Move to the next uncompleted step

### Phase 4: Completion

When all steps are done:
1. Update plan.md status to "✅ Completed"
2. Create a `workspace/<task>/summary.md` with:
   - What was accomplished
   - Key results and deliverables
   - Any follow-up items
3. Present the final result to the user

## Adaptive Replanning

If during execution you discover:
- A step is impossible → Mark it `[!]` with a reason, add alternative steps
- New steps are needed → Add them to the plan with `[+]` prefix
- A step produced unexpected results → Add a note and adjust subsequent steps
- The plan needs major changes → Create a new section "## Revised Plan" and follow it

Always update plan.md BEFORE changing course, so the plan stays the source of truth.

## Error Handling

- If a tool call fails, retry once. If it fails again, mark the step as blocked and note the error.
- Never silently skip a step. Always update the plan to reflect what happened.
- If you're stuck, tell the user what's blocking and ask for guidance.

## Example Scenarios

### Example 1: "Research our top 3 competitors and write a comparison report"

Plan would be:
```
- [ ] 1. Identify the user's company/product context
- [ ] 2. Research Competitor A — website, pricing, features
- [ ] 3. Research Competitor B — website, pricing, features
- [ ] 4. Research Competitor C — website, pricing, features
- [ ] 5. Create comparison matrix
- [ ] 6. Write analysis and recommendations
- [ ] 7. Compile final report
```

### Example 2: "Analyze our Q4 sales data and prepare a board presentation"

Plan would be:
```
- [ ] 1. Read and understand the sales data files
- [ ] 2. Calculate key metrics (revenue, growth, trends)
- [ ] 3. Identify top insights and anomalies
- [ ] 4. Create data summary tables
- [ ] 5. Draft presentation outline
- [ ] 6. Write each presentation section
- [ ] 7. Add executive summary
- [ ] 8. Review and polish final document
```

## Key Principles

1. **Plan is the source of truth** — Always update it before moving on
2. **One step at a time** — Don't skip ahead or batch too many steps
3. **Show your work** — Save intermediate results to the task folder
4. **Communicate progress** — The user can read plan.md at any time to see status
5. **Be adaptive** — Plans change; that's OK if you update the plan first
